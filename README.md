## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On completing this small project of HTML and CSS I learned about the CSS flexbox and other positioning related concepts which is important to align the stuff in the project.

Code snippets of CSS flexbox and other useful properties used in this project attached below:

```html
<div class="container">// Code --- You can find it in index.html file</div>
```

```css
.container {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0px;
  margin: auto;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me in understanding css flexbox with different examples. I really liked this documentation and will use it going forward.
